            <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star">star</a> is an astronomical object consisting of a 
                luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. 
                Many other stars are visible to the naked 
                eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky</li>
