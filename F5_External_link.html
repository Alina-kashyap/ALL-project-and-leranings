        <p>Lonar Crater sits inside the Deccan Plateau – a massive plain of volcanic
             basalt rock created by eruptions some 65 million years ago. Its location 
             in this<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonar_Lake"> basalt</a> field suggested to some geologists that it was a volcanic
              crater. Today, however, Lonar Crater is understood to be the result
               of a meteorite impact that occurred between 35,000 and 50,000 years
                ago.[9] The water in the lake is both saline and alkaline.

            <p>The lush forests and marshlands of southern India’s Nagarahole National Park, also known as Rajiv Gandhi National Park, form one of the country’s premier tiger destinations. Backed by the hills of 
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats" target="_blank">Western Ghats</a>, the park is filled with fragrant sandalwood and teak trees, thick groves of bamboo, and dozens of winding streams. A jeep safari is the best option to spot big cats, while a slow drift in a coracle—a small round boat—along the Kabini River offers prime viewing opportunities for aquatic birds, crocodiles, and Indian elephants.
