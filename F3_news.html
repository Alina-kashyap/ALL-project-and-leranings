            <h3>The 10-day mission will use the company's Crew Dragon capsule</h3>
            <img src="Photosss/space.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>Houston-based private space company Axiom has forged a partnership 
            with SpaceX to fly paying tourists to the ISS as soon as the second half of 2021. 
            Under the terms of their deal, <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX </a>will use the Crew Dragon capsule to ferry
             three tourists and an Axiom staff member, who'll make sure they don't interfere
              with the <span>NASA crew members </span>doing their job, to the orbiting lab. It's worth 
              noting that Axiom was the company NASA chose to build the space station's 
              first commercial destination module.
